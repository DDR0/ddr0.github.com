<h2>Diagrams and Charts of Game Mechanics</h2>
<p>Most games have an overarching "formula" which determines the broad strokes of gameplay. The shape of the curves that the formula would make when charted offer answers to some surprisingly basic questions, like "Will the game be fun?" or "Will the game be winnable at all?"
</p>
<!-- Progress Quest -->
<p>To determine what a chart looks like, we need to figure out the major elements of a game, and their relationships. Lets start with the simplest example -- Progress Quest. [<a href="http://progressquest.com/">site</a>/<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W2DyOWPbAA">lp</a>]

Here, we see a constantly granted resource, time. Via the mechanics of the game, time is directly converted into progress. Therefore, the game's "progress" has a linear relation to the amount of time passed.

Since no other factors influence the game, it's a very simple graph.

<!-- OpenTTD -->
<div id="hr"></div>
<p>OpenTTD [<a href="http://www.openttd.org/">site</a>/<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CoAKmx6sfZc">lp</a>] is a bit more complex. The goal of OpenTTD is to collect the most money by the end, as score is pretty much irrelevant. Money is earned by a vehicle, and is called operating profit. So, what affects money? Routes, primarily. A "route" is the collective station, infrastructure, and vehicle required to make money.

Graph #1 agrees with the focus of the game quite well - OpenTTD is, fundamentally, a game about building routes to transport goods along. When a node appears connected to many other elements, but is <em>not</em> the focus of the game, the game will suffer because because that node <em>will be</em> the focus of the player. (Example: Sim City 4) <!-- TODO: Link to Sim City paragraph. --> Odd focus is a common symptom shoddy design. Note that money is not the focus of the graph -- although much links to it, it's merely a limiting factor. For an example of a game where money would be considered a focus, check out Railroad Tycoon II.

</p>
<p>Anyway, Graph #1 details a route the broadest sense. It is not weighted for the intensity of the interaction, as it's just a first step to let us see the basics of the system. It lets us consider the fundamental growth pattern in OpenTTD - the player spends time and money to build a route so that the player has money during the time she is building another route. Route-building behavior will exponentially increase in frequency until the player can constantly build new routes. Since income grows exponentially during this period, it shifts the bottleneck resource to player's time and effort. This averts runaway exponential growth -- almost! <!-- TODO: Make 'almost' a link, which pops in the next paragraph. -->
</p>
<p id="popin">With the cause and effect laid out, we can identify the 'weak point' in the limiting effect. If the player were to be able to create new routes without spending time to do so, she would be able to exponentially increase her income until she hit hardware limits. A bit of background: OpenTTD has four transport types: road, rail, ship, and air. Vehicles on road rail, and airport tarmac can't pass each other (for the most part) and congestion will force new infrastructure to be built by the player. However, for whatever reason, ships don't block each other. They are, however, limited by water tiles being ruinously expensive to build. Although a large amount of infrastructure exists naturally (aka "oceans") it only serves a small percentage of the world. This normally limits the usefulness of ships, as there are only so many routes to capitalize on. However, after we have engaged in exponential growth to the point of running out of time on land, we can exploit the waterways' unique ability to be able to carry an infinite number of routes on a single tile. After we have grown our income on land, we will have enough money to be able to afford huge canal systems. This, combined with the large cities we grew as we expanded, gives us a huge supply of passengers to transport by water. Because we can reuse existing canals, the amount of time it takes to build a new route is minimal. With the limiting factor on our growth rate removed, the game will end in short order as we have to stop building new routes. (Either the hardware can't handle it or we encounter a hard limit on the number of vehicles.)
</p>
<p>Graph #2 partially describes the workings of a route. Players must figure out a complex web of relationships to make a route highly profitable -- where it should connect, how fast it should go, what type of vehicle it should run it, and so on. This presents the challenge in the game, and is "the fun bit".
</p>
<p>The graph does, however, represent a downside to the visualization technique. Since it focuses on the vehicle to money connection, it is incomplete. Because it is incomplete, it is misleading. As it stands, it would suggest that vehicles are the core of the route system. I would consider the infrastructure to be worth more, since it's what the player spends the majority of her time building. (Especially with trains. You have to build signals and everything.) It is very hard to consider everything when making a graph, as incomplete graphs can look quite finished. There are no 'warning signs'. That said, with careful consideration, a good graph can be quite helpful. Just make sure it does not go against common sense. It is a just tool for thinking, after all, not an oracle.
