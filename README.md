=======

This is the website of DDR. Contributions, changes, and so on are welcomed. The site can be found live [ddr0.ca](https://ddr0.ca). It used to live at [ddr0.github.io](https://ddr0.github.io/).

Building:
---------

To compile the site, run `./build.js`, or `./build.js --watch`. You can install the dependancies with `make install-build-reqs`. Some of the smaller projects will require a node server to be run, in which case you will need to proxy to them as described for Nginx in [~/site-config/setup.sh](./site-config/setup.sh). (See [~/site-config/example nginx configuration.txt](./site-config/example nginx configuration.txt).)
