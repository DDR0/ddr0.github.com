=======

This is the website of DDR. Contributions, changes, and so on are welcomed. The site can be found live [ddr0.ca](https://ddr0.ca) or [ddr0.github.io](https://ddr0.github.io/).

Building:
---------

To compile the site, run `./build.js`, or `./build.js --watch`. You can install the dependancies with `make install-build-reqs`. Although the site can be served any way, I like to use `python3 -m http.server 8080`. (See [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).)
