Contributing:
The main site is generated using "less" and "haml" in place of the standard "css" and "html". Before editing a html file, make sure there isn't a haml file next to it. When the site is compiled, the haml file will overwrite the html file. To compile the site, use Linux and run the compile bash script. ({{{./compile.sh}}}) Thank you for your patience.
