				<p>On Feb 23, 2012, I added a test page to my personal website at http://ddr0.github.com, using <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a>. Three years later, I purchased ddr0.ca and started redirecting the domain name to http://ddr0.github.io, which Github had migrated Pages to after <a href="https://github.blog/2013-04-05-new-github-pages-domain-github-io/">some security issues</a> arising from having them on a subdomain of the main site. A few years after that, I started hosting my website myself on a VPS at <a href="https://cloudatcost.com">Cloud at Cost</a>. I kept the Github Pages in case anything went wrong. Ultimately, it did - the VPS service slowly died of oversubscription a few months ago. (It was an excellent service for many yearsâ€”and for less than a dollar a month!)</p>
				
				<p>As my web server slowly fell out from under me, taking upwards of half a minute to run <code>ls</code>, I retreated to my living room where this site is hosted now. I had deployed a highly-accessible DnD-style dice roller, <a href="https://ddr0.ca/%F0%9F%8E%B2/">ðŸŽ²</a>, but it required a <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node</a>-based service running on the back-end to perform the rolls.</p>
				
				<p>While I'd known it for some time, this really drove home that ddr0.ca is no longer hostable entirely on Github Pages. I need to maintain a server running it, so there's no reason to keep ddr0.github.io around. The <a href="https://github.com/DDR0/ddr0.github.com">code for ddr0.ca</a> will remain happily on Github itself, but starting today any requests to a web page on Github Pages will redirect to the equivalent page on ddr0.ca.</p>
				
				<p>As I don't have a whole lot of control over how Github Pages serves my content, I've <a href="https://github.com/DDR0/ddr0.github.com/tree/github-pages-shell">replaced the content</a> of each HTML file with a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/meta#examples">meta redirect</a> and deleted most of the other files. This means that, as far as I can manage, the URLs that have been linked around the web should still work. <a href="https://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI">Cool URLs don't change.</a></p>
				
				<p>Moving forward, I should get the releases for my old projects (River Run, Cube Trains, and the Open Pixel Platformer demo) out of this repo. Github has the concept of releases now, and I would like to use that instead of the repo for my website. The files will still be hosted on this website as insurance against something going missing, of course, <em>since you only own something if it's on your computer.</em> And, of course, I'd like to update this blog a little more. I need a reason to implement pagination!</p>
