				<p>Yesterday, I solved a long-standing question I'd had - how do you get data out of a  WebAssembly program without having to copy it back? Ideally, in such a way that a web worker wouldn't have to copy it back to the main thread either. I've been able to find some information on this around the web, but much of it seems to be rather outdated or does not address the issue. I decided to have a crack at it myself and figure out the state of the art by writing a small proof-of-concept.</p>
				
				<h3>Version 1</h3>
				
				<p>My first approach was to try to create the web worker using a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/SharedArrayBuffer">SharedArrayBuffer</a> backing its code. As a bonus, we should be able to redefine bytecode on the fly then which will be fun.</p>
				
				<p>Copying from <a href="https://depth-first.com/articles/2020/01/13/first-steps-in-webassembly-hello-world/">Depth-First's excellent guide</a> (read it before this post), we arrive at something like this:</p>

				</code>
				
				<p>Here, we start by defining some <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/WebAssembly/Memory/Memory">WebAssembly memory</a> to pass args around with. (The <code>initial</code> value is in number of 64-KiB pages to allocate.) We then define a function, <code>log</code>, which will take this memory and print the contents using <code>console.log(…)</code>. We'll call this from our WASM code, which we've serialised in this case as a base64 string. (The source of which is <a href="/blog-posts/13.Shared_Array_Buffers_With_WASM/hello.1.wat">hello.1.wat</a>, compiled using <a href="https://webassembly.github.io/wabt/doc/wat2wasm.1.html">wat2wasm</a> from <a href="https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt">WABT</a>.)</p>
				
				<p>To get our shared memory, we create a new array backed by a <code>SharedArrayBuffer</code>. In JS, all the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/TypedArray"><em>typed</em> arrays</a> have a backing buffer. Usually, by default, it's an <code>ArrayBuffer</code>. Amusingly enough, an <code>ArrayBuffer</code> <em>can</em> be shared between multiple typed arrays, even of different types. The <code>SharedArrayBuffer</code> is called so because it can be passed between web workers without copying as well, which a regular <code>ArrayBuffer</code> can't do. This is the behaviour we're after.</p>
				
				<p>So, let's test it! First, we'll set the final byte of our WASM program to <code>?</code>, from it's original value of <code>!</code>, to prove we're loading the right memory and can manipulate it. Then, we start the WebAssembly program and call the <code>hello()</code> function of the <code>instance</code> we created. This in turn calls our <code>log()</code>, which prints "Hello, world?".</p>
				
				<p class="noindent"><em>(Note: <code>WebAssembly.instantiate(…)</code> will also let you pass in an <code>ArrayBuffer</code>/<code>TypedArrayBuffer</code>, in addition to the <code>Uint8Array</code> we have here… in Firefox and not in Chrome.)</em></p>
				
				<p>Now we modify our memory again, this time changing the final byte to <code>.</code>. However, calling into <code>hello</code> again, we find we get the same output, "Hello, world?". We can't just poke the memory of a running WASM program, it would seem - probably for the best. So, what do we do now?</p>
				
				<h3>Version 2</h3>
				
				<p>We have one other memory-buffer-ish object we can tweak. Let's see if we can't get that initial <code>const memory = …</code> declaration to be a shared buffer, instead of an unshared buffer. Some brief searching later, and we find that <code>WebAssembly.Memory</code> can indeed take a <code>shared</code> flag. It's not very well supported, but let's rework our code to try to test it anyway. (I believe the <code>shared</code> flag is part of the <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2018/10/wasm-threads">WebAssembly Threads</a> system, which seems to just be referring to using shared memory to communicate between workers VS message passing.)</p>

				<p>With our new memory declaration returning a shared buffer… on most non-Apple desktop browsers… 😬 we can now test this method of memory manipulation. We immediately find three things:
				<ol>
					<li>Our WASM program needs to have it's memory declaration updated too, yielding <a href="/blog-posts/13.Shared_Array_Buffers_With_WASM/hello.2.wat">hello.2.wat</a> and a new base64 blob.</li>
					<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/TextDecoder"><code>TextDecoder</code></a> doesn't accept a SharedArrayBuffer, so we have to write our own little routine here. I guess this is because, as the bytes could change at any time, we could potentially output invalid utf-8 as our data shifted under us. We don't care for this single-threaded demo, but it would be an issue normally.</li>
					<li>We must capture the newly-shared text buffer in the callback (as <code>globalBytes</code>), so we won't bother manipulating it before we instantiate our WebAssembly program.</li>
				</ol>
				<p>To test this, we call <code>hello()</code> again, which sets <code>globalBytes</code> to our "Hello, world!" message. We now set the first character to an apostrophe, and call in to our function again to test if we were able to set data visible to WASM. It prints "'ello, world!", thus demonstrating we are! Since we're working with a <code>SharedArrayBuffer</code> here, we can share this reference across threads to get fast, efficient data transfer.</p>

				<p><code>test.js</code> only runs once, despite being included twice. It seems modules have a specific trait where they're only ever evaluated once, I believe specified in <a href="https://262.ecma-international.org/6.0/#sec-moduleevaluation">steps 4 and 5 of ECMAScript 6.0 section 15.2.1.16.5</a>.</p>
				
				<p class=noindent>Nothing good ever comes of running scripts multiple times. I'm glad it's out.</p>
				
				<p class=noindent>P.S.: Fun fact: You can still <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/open"><code>document.write(…)</code></a> in an ECMAScript module, which just feels… <em>wrong.</em> (At least the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/with">with</a> statement is history there, as modules are always in strict mode.)</p>

				<p>On Feb 23, 2012, I added a test page to my personal website at http://ddr0.github.com, using <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a>. Three years later, I purchased ddr0.ca and started redirecting the domain name to http://ddr0.github.io, which Github had migrated Pages to after <a href="https://github.blog/2013-04-05-new-github-pages-domain-github-io/">some security issues</a> arising from having them on a subdomain of the main site. A few years after that, I started hosting my website myself on a VPS at <a href="https://cloudatcost.com">Cloud at Cost</a>. I kept the Github Pages in case anything went wrong. Ultimately, it did - the VPS service slowly died of oversubscription a few months ago. (It was an excellent service for many years—and for less than a dollar a month!)</p>
				
				<p>As my web server slowly fell out from under me, taking upwards of half a minute to run <code>ls</code>, I retreated to my living room where this site is hosted now. I had deployed a highly-accessible DnD-style dice roller, <a href="https://ddr0.ca/%F0%9F%8E%B2/">🎲</a>, but it required a <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node</a>-based service running on the back-end to perform the rolls.</p>
				
				<p>While I'd known it for some time, this really drove home that ddr0.ca is no longer hostable entirely on Github Pages. I need to maintain a server running it, so there's no reason to keep ddr0.github.io around. The <a href="https://github.com/DDR0/ddr0.github.com">code for ddr0.ca</a> will remain happily on Github itself, but starting today any requests to a web page on Github Pages will redirect to the equivalent page on ddr0.ca.</p>
				
				<p>As I don't have a whole lot of control over how Github Pages serves my content, I've <a href="https://github.com/DDR0/ddr0.github.com/tree/github-pages-shell">replaced the content</a> of each HTML file with a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/meta#examples">meta redirect</a> and deleted most of the other files. This means that, as far as I can manage, the URLs that have been linked around the web should still work. <a href="https://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI">Cool URLs don't change.</a></p>
				
				<p>Moving forward, I should get the releases for my old projects (River Run, Cube Trains, and the Open Pixel Platformer demo) out of this repo. Github has the concept of releases now, and I would like to use that instead of the repo for my website. The files will still be hosted on this website as insurance against something going missing, of course, <em>since you only own something if it's on your computer.</em> And, of course, I'd like to update this blog a little more. I need a reason to implement pagination!</p>

										<h2 id="balancing-braces">
											<a href="/blog-posts/08.Balancing_Braces">Balancing Braces</a>
										</h2>
				
						
				<p>I chanced to read an article this morning on <a href="https://medium.com/@benastontweet/balancing-braces-a76e7b8e5f04">Ben Aston's blog</a>, which dealt with balancing braces. You should go read it now, since it's good and since I'm about to critique the heck out of his approach.</p>
				
				<p>The task Ben sets himself is simple: write a Javascript function, isBalanced, that returns true if a set of braces is balanced. Running his solution through <a href="https://jshint.com">jshint</a>, we find it has 13 statements with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclomatic_complexity">cyclomatic</a> complexity score of 6. I think it is an inelegant solution for an elegant problem, as my solution came in at 4 statements with a complexity score of 2. (And mine doesn't repeat the characters to be matched either. <img class="emote" src="/images/wesnoth%20icons/icon_wink.gif"> )</p>
				
				<h3>Analysis</h3>
				<p>This can be looked at not as a parsing problem, but as a pattern-matching problem instead. You have to think about it recursively.</p>
				
				<p>The key insight we will use is that <strong>this problem is as easy as repeatedly removing pairs of braces</strong>, such as <code>()</code> or <code>[]</code>. There is no case where the braces could be balanced without a pair of braces occurring in the string. By repeatedly removing all the paired braces, we will end up with either an empty string or the non-matching braces.</p>
				
				<p>Let's work this through. <code>'[{}]'</code> has one pair of braces we can spot - <code>{}</code>. Remove it and we are left with <code>'[]'</code> and another pair, <code>[]</code>, which we can also remove. Are there any characters left? No? Then the input was balanced. However, <code>'[{]}'</code> has no pairs of braces, and does have characters left, so it's unbalanced. <code>'()['</code> reduces to <code>'['</code>, which is likewise unbalanced.</p>
				
				<h3>Solution</h3>
				<div class="code-container">
					<code>function isBalanced(braces) {</code>
					<code>	do {</code>
					<code>		var matches = braces.split(/\(\)|{}|\[]/);</code>
					<code>		braces = matches.join('');</code>
					<code>	} while (matches.length > 1);</code>
					<code>	return !braces;</code>
					<code>}</code>
				</div>
				
				<br>
				
				<figure style="padding-top:1em">
					<iframe src="blog-posts/08.Balancing_Braces/example" style="height:26ex" scrolling="no"></iframe>
					<figcaption style="padding-top:1em"><strong>Live Example:</strong> All tests passing.</figcaption>
				</figure>
				
				<p>Given this solution, Ben's statement that "to solve this problem we need to have a function that will return the opener corresponding to a closer" is proven false. We have no such function, and we have solved the problem.</p>
				
				<h3>Comparison</h3>
				<p>In our code, <strong>there's a lot of things we don't have to worry about.</strong> We don't have to worry about inverting characters. We don't have to worry about queues. We don't have to worry about what the schema is, or even what <em>a</em> schema is. <strong>We just remove characters from a string.</strong></p>
				
				<p>This post is a lot shorter than Ben's, because my solution is a lot simpler. Often you do not have to think of the right data structure, but instead spend some time thinking of the right algorithm. My solution is simpler, but perhaps Ben's is constrained by an outside influence, not stated in the problem - say, the user of the function will want an error message pointing to the mismatched brace. While we should always strive for the clearest code, it's worth remembering that sometimes it was done that way for a reason.</p>

										<h2 id="text-templating">
											<a href="/blog-posts/06.Text_Templating">A Case Against Text Templating</a>
										</h2>
				
						
				<p>I recently had to deal with a mature PHP-based application. While quite well maintained, the code was suffering heavily from the effects of greedy serialization. Most templating languages, PHP included, work by going along and imperatively creating a long string of text. Echo this, buffer that, and concatenate the whole shebang into an outgoing HTML file. This is a powerful approach, beautiful in the simplicity of its method, and infinitely embeddable.</p>
				
				<p>It is also a a trap.</p>
				
				<p>Say you are creating a function to make a "breadcrumb trail" style nav bar. It's used on every page of your app, and it's pretty standard. You have a few ordered fields such as company, contact, and job; and a few custom ones which will be passed in as an argument. The function signature looks like getBreadcrumb(context[, extraListItems]).</p>
				
				<p>Some time later, you find you need to give a custom ID to one of the standard breadcrumb links. So, you go back to the getBreadcrumb() function and add in another parameter, a list of IDs corresponding to the produced list of elements. Now the function looks like getBreadcrumb(context[, extraListItems[, listItemIDs]]).</p>
				
				<p>After the ID mechanism is firmly entrenched in your codebase, you are asked to add a class to the second breadcrumb item. Because you're a good programmer, and can see where this is headed, you make the mechanism generic. You can now pass in a list of maps such as {id: 'foo', class: 'bar baz'}. Now, the signature looks like getBreadcrumb(context[, extraListItems[, listItemIDs[, listItemAttributes]]]).</p>
				
				<p>A few months later, a bug report comes in. On one page in, say, the Financials module, the breadcrumb is showing up as being in the Reports module and people can't navigate back to their financials. When you look at it, you find it's a simple problem - it's a financial <em>report</em>. The fix adds in another parameter to the getBreadcrumbList function called 'hideAutomaticBreadcrumbs'.</p>
				
				<p>Now we have a beast of a function with five arguments, one of which is redundant. (Many calls look like getBreadcrumb(this->context, null, null, [[], [], ['id'=>'currentJobName']]).) It's not even so much a big function as it is an <em>awkward</em> one. It's hard to test as well. What's more, the pattern has repeated itself across most of the code. Some of the functions even have more than a dozen arguments! How do we avoid this? At every step, adding one more arg seemed like the right thing to do.</p>
				
				<p>The problem with the input of the function was actually caused by the output of the function. getBreadcrumb() returns strings of HTML, which are written to the document we're generating. However, this means that getBreadcrumb() is the <strong>final</strong> place we can manipulate and change the breadcrumbs. To fix this, let's try re-running our scenario. However this time, instead of returning HTML to be echo'd to the document, we will generate a tree structure to represent our HTML. Unlike the text representation, the tree will have all the relevant attributes open to manipulation later in the program. So, we might access the breadcrumb trail via html.body.topNav.breadcrumb. The second breadcrumb item might be accessed via something like breadcrumb.li[1], where breadcrumb is an ordered list.</p>
				
				<p>Now that the structure is available to us, the custom breadcrumb id argument is thrown away – never existed – because we can simply go breadcrumb[1].li.id = "customID". We don't have to generate the list with customID, because we can change it after we've generated it. Same thing with the attributes list we added when we needed classes.</p>
				
				<p>The bug report about one of the list items being incorrect is similarly solved by modifying the offending item in place, as a one-off change.</p>
				
				<p>Now the getBreadcrumb(context[, extraListItems]) call is manageable. Special cases are handled locally, and the arguments list is not polluted with redundant behaviour. By discarding the structural information of our HTML document only after we're done creating all of it, we are free to manipulate it as we need to. Because we don't have to write a function to generate the perfect breadcrumb trail every time, we are able to write a simple one that just generates a good default breadcrumb trail.</p>

				<div class="no-p-indent">
					<p>Problem: Given a ball and a curved wall, how do we calculate the angle of the bounce of the ball? Assuming we have the normal of the wall at the bounce location, our problem becomes:</p>
					<p>Problem: Given two vectors, x₁ and n, how do we mirror vector x₁ around vector n to get x′? (x₁ is the ball velocity and n is the normal of the wall.)</p>
				
					<p>Solution: Implement <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Reflection.html">https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Reflection.html</a> (The first picture is accurate to the situation.)</p>
				
					<p>As written: x₁′ = -x₁ + 2x₀ + 2n̂[(x₁-x₀)·n̂]</p>
				
					<p>Given that x₀ is always [0,0], it can be ignored.</p>
				
					<p>x₁′ = -x₁ + 2n̂[x₁·n̂]</p>
				
					<p>Given that n is pre-normalized, we can un-hat the ns.</p>
				
					<p>x₁′ = -x₁ + 2n[x₁·n]</p>
				
					<p>To calculate the dot product: (from <a href="https://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/vectors-dot-product.html">https://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/vectors-dot-product.html</a>)</p>
				
					<p>x₁′ = -x₁ + 2n[x₁[0]*n[0]+x₁[1]*n[1]]</p>
				
					<p>Normalize the notation, since we're now using [0] to get the vector components.</p>
				
					<p>x₁′ = -x₁ + 2*n*(x₁[0]*n[0]+x₁[1]*n[1])</p>
				
					<p>Now, to calculate both parts of the vector separately:</p>
				
					<p>x₁[0]′ = -x₁[0] + 2*n[0]*(x₁[0]*n[0]+x₁[1]*n[1])</p>
					<p>x₁[1]′ = -x₁[1] + 2*n[1]*(x₁[0]*n[0]+x₁[1]*n[1])</p>
				
					<p>Now you can replace the x₁ and n with the variables of your program, and be on your way. For example, in Javascript:
					<div class="code-container">
						<code>//Returns vector v mirrored around the normalized vector mir.</code>
						<code>function vReflectIn(v,mir) { </code>
						<code>	return [</code>
						<code>		-v[0] + 2*mir[0]*(v[0]*mir[0]+v[1]*mir[1]),</code>
						<code>		-v[1] + 2*mir[1]*(v[0]*mir[0]+v[1]*mir[1]),</code>
						<code>	]; </code>
						<code>}</code>

So, in rough order of my progression through the library, here are 5 examples:</p>
				<h3>Example 1: A Basic Scene</h3>
				<iframe id="clouds-1" class="iframe-player" data-code-source="blog-posts/03.CreateJS_Examples/1-0 Clouds" width="300" height="150" scrolling="no"></iframe>
					<div class="iframe-player-buttons">
						<button onclick="createjsExamples.play('clouds-1', 'blog-posts/03.CreateJS_Examples/1-0 Clouds');">play</button>
						<button onclick="createjsExamples.stop('clouds-1');">stop</button>
						<button onclick="createjsExamples.show('clouds-1', 'blog-posts/03.CreateJS_Examples/1-0 Clouds');">code</button>
					</div>
				<script>createjsExamples.play('clouds-1', 'blog-posts/03.CreateJS_Examples/1-0 Clouds'); //A sort of 'hook' for the post, perhaps? Ideally, would only be enabled if this were the first post on the page.</script>
				<p>We'll start with a small platformer mockup, very basic. In it, we want to have some clouds float behind the player. We'll create a new HTML file, <span class="cjs-line 5">import our library</span>, and write a simple scene. (You can grab the library I used from <a class="external" href="https://code.createjs.com/createjs-2013.05.14.min.js">https://code.createjs.com/createjs-2013.05.14.min.js</a>. Other versions are available on the <a href="https://code.createjs.com/">CDN page</a>.)</p>
				<p>As a first attempt, we add the <span class="cjs-line 25">ground</span>, <span class="cjs-line 30">a cloud</span>, and <span class="cjs-line 41">an actor</span>. Since we're planning to add more clouds later, we've made that code a function. And – what do you know, it works! Our little cloud wafts gently across the sky, behind our actor.</p>
				<p>(Aside: To view the code for the example, I recommend moving the tab the 'code' button opens to a new window… the popup code can be a bit flaky. When you mouse over the highlights here, they'll highlight there as well. A more reliable way to view the code might be to play the example, and then select 'view frame source' from the right-click menu. The code is also available on <a href="https://github.com/DDR0/ddr0.github.com/tree/master/blog-posts/03.CreateJS_Examples">Github</a>.)</p>
				<iframe id="clouds-2" class="iframe-player" data-code-source="blog-posts/03.CreateJS_Examples/1-1 Clouds" width="300" height="150" scrolling="no"></iframe>
					<div class="iframe-player-buttons">
						<button onclick="createjsExamples.play('clouds-2', 'blog-posts/03.CreateJS_Examples/1-1 Clouds');">play</button>
						<button onclick="createjsExamples.stop('clouds-2');">stop</button>
						<button onclick="createjsExamples.show('clouds-2', 'blog-posts/03.CreateJS_Examples/1-1 Clouds');">code</button>
					</div>
				<p>Here, we've added <span class="cjs-line 30 31 32 33">a function to add clouds to our scene every two seconds</span>. While the first cloud works just fine, the other clouds float over our player because they're added after the player is. An index-based solution, like "add this after the first 5 objects", will be a rolling disaster. The best way I've found so far to deal with this problem, generally, is to have named z-orders. Even giving z-orders by an arbitrary number grows difficult to manage after a while.</p>
				<p>Z-orders are also known as layers, and fill the same role as a 3D game's depth buffer.</p>
				<iframe id="clouds-3" class="iframe-player" data-code-source="blog-posts/03.CreateJS_Examples/1-2 Clouds" width="300" height="150" scrolling="no"></iframe>
					<div class="iframe-player-buttons">
						<button onclick="createjsExamples.play('clouds-3', 'blog-posts/03.CreateJS_Examples/1-2 Clouds');">play</button>
						<button onclick="createjsExamples.stop('clouds-3');">stop</button>
						<button onclick="createjsExamples.show('clouds-3', 'blog-posts/03.CreateJS_Examples/1-2 Clouds');">code</button>
					</div>
				<p>Luckily, CreateJS implements the best of the three systems. They just don't tell you about it. Instead, <a href="https://www.createjs.com/Docs/EaselJS/classes/Container">the documentation</a> merely suggests that containers are a good way of grouping together objects that you would like to transform in the same manner. They are also a <em>great</em> way of grouping together objects you'd like to keep beneath other objects. At the start of the program, you can define all the z-orders that will exist as containers, and give them descriptive names. Now, as the program progresses, we can add objects into the right layer.</p>
				<p>Here, we've added some <span class="cjs-line 17">containers</span> to the stage, and <span class="cjs-line 23 24 25">passed those containers into the various functions that add our objects</span>. Now, although <span class="cjs-line 36 41 52">our functions are unchanged</span> from the previous example, we have our clouds correctly added to the middle layer.</p>
				<h3>Example 2: Caching & Performance</h3>
				<p>In many games, we use a board or background that we don't want to have move every frame. For example, we might have a scorecard that we put some text objects on, or a game where you have a few animated actors on a still background. We'll look at a dummy minesweeper game with two blue bars that track the mouse.</p>
				<iframe id="mines-1" class="iframe-player" data-code-source="blog-posts/03.CreateJS_Examples/2-0 Minesweeper" width="320" height="320" scrolling="no"></iframe>
					<div class="iframe-player-buttons">
						<button onclick="createjsExamples.play('mines-1', 'blog-posts/03.CreateJS_Examples/2-0 Minesweeper');">play</button>
						<button onclick="createjsExamples.stop('mines-1');">stop</button>
						<button onclick="createjsExamples.show('mines-1', 'blog-posts/03.CreateJS_Examples/2-0 Minesweeper');">code</button>
					</div>
				<p>To build an example that stresses our computer a little, we'll make a simple game of minesweeper with each tile as an image object. Our play-field is <span class="cjs-line 22">40² tiles</span>, so we'll have 1600 objects to play around with. We'll lay some <span class="cjs-line 38 39">blue bars</span> on top to provide interactivity for the demo.</p>
				<p>If we play the example and open up our task manager, or shift-esc on Chrome, we can see that the game is taking up more CPU than it should be. (It uses about 90% here, and lags like crazy.) CreateJS is geared towards creating fully dynamic scenes, so unless we explicitly tell it that it can cache an object, it will render that object to canvas each frame. As a result, our simple game has to draw 1600 objects <span class="cjs-line 53">50 times a second</span>.</p>
				<iframe id="mines-2" class="iframe-player" data-code-source="blog-posts/03.CreateJS_Examples/2-1 Minesweeper" width="320" height="320" scrolling="no"></iframe>
					<div class="iframe-player-buttons">
						<button onclick="createjsExamples.play('mines-2', 'blog-posts/03.CreateJS_Examples/2-1 Minesweeper');">play</button>
						<button onclick="createjsExamples.stop('mines-2');">stop</button>
						<button onclick="createjsExamples.show('mines-2', 'blog-posts/03.CreateJS_Examples/2-1 Minesweeper');">code</button>
					</div>
				<p>To fix this, we'll <span class="cjs-line 20">cache the background layer</span> that is holding the tiles. Now, when we go to draw a frame to screen, we'll just draw three objects – the background, and the two blue bars on top of it. However, we will need to refresh our cache when it goes stale. The cash starts empty, so we'll add <span class="cjs-line 31">a refresh call when we've loaded the tile image we need to update it</span> on line 31. The only time the player will invalidate the cash is when they click on a tile, so we'll add in a similar call to <span class="cjs-line 37">refresh the cache when the tile's "clicked" image is ready to be drawn</span>. (If we had used <a href="https://www.createjs.com/#!/PreloadJS">PreloadJS</a>, we wouldn't have to wait to update the cache here.)</p>
				<p>Now, making sure we stop the first example before measuring the CPU usage of the second, we find that our game only uses a little bit of our available CPU. My edition of Chrome reports about 15% usage, and I don't experience the lag that the first version had.</p>
				<p>Many older games drew the mouse cursor on screen in the manner we draw the blue bars here. This was because the common operating systems at the time could only render a simple black-and-white image as a custom cursor. This introduced around one to three frames of delay between moving the mouse and seeing the results, depending on how many steps the rendering pipeline was. This was barely noticeable when the game ran fast, but when you dipped down into 20 or 30 fps moving the mouse became a bit of a speculative operation. Today, most everything (including Javascript, via CSS) supports full-colour custom cursors.</p>
				<em>
				<p>Update: Sebastian DeRossi, from the CreateJS team, has sent me a reworked version previous minesweeper example!</p>
				<iframe id="mines-3" class="iframe-player" data-code-source="blog-posts/03.CreateJS_Examples/2-2 Minesweeper Remastered" width="320" height="320" scrolling="no"></iframe>
					<div class="iframe-player-buttons">

				To be honest, it has been about half a year since I wrote this and he replied and I got around to trying to figure out what was happening. I don't really know what to make of this, code-wise…
				<img class="emote" src="/images/wesnoth icons/icon_pensive.gif">
				It's a remarkably different way to do things, and probably quite a bit more robust!
				</p>
				</em>
				<h3>Example 3: Resizing</h3>
				<p>A proper web-based game ought to be able to resize gracefully with the browser, especially on mobile where a game might be flipped around as the device rotates.</p>
				<p>Here, <span class="cjs-line 45 58">we'll draw a rotating circle</span>. We'll be able to see the redraw area, and any extra logic frames that are caused by our changes. If we drag the corner, we can see a bit of lag and flickering as the <span class="cjs-line 68">resizing logic</span> clears the canvas before a repaint occurs. There is a bit of messiness surrounding the resizing, because there is no event fired when a DOM element changes size.</p>
				<iframe id="resize-2" class="iframe-player" data-code-source="blog-posts/03.CreateJS_Examples/3-1 Resize" width="300" height="250" scrolling="no"></iframe>
					<div class="iframe-player-buttons">
						<button onclick="createjsExamples.play('resize-2', 'blog-posts/03.CreateJS_Examples/3-1 Resize');">play</button>
						<button onclick="createjsExamples.stop('resize-2');">stop</button>
						<button onclick="createjsExamples.show('resize-2', 'blog-posts/03.CreateJS_Examples/3-1 Resize');">code</button>
					</div>
				<p>To get rid of the resizing flicker, we just have to re-render the stage when the element is resized. This is easily accomplished by <span class="cjs-line 64">a single call to the stage's update method</span> on line 64.</p>
				<h3>Example 4: Working with the DOM</h3>
				<p>When making an HTML5 game, it is a good idea to actually use traditional HTML5 to lay out the interface for your game. Layout is, after all, what HTML5 was born for.</p>
				<iframe id="DOM-1" class="iframe-player" data-code-source="blog-posts/03.CreateJS_Examples/4-0 DOM Interface" width="300" height="200" scrolling="no"></iframe>
					<div class="iframe-player-buttons">
						<button onclick="createjsExamples.play('DOM-1', 'blog-posts/03.CreateJS_Examples/4-0 DOM Interface');">play</button>
						<button onclick="createjsExamples.stop('DOM-1');">stop</button>
						<button onclick="createjsExamples.show('DOM-1', 'blog-posts/03.CreateJS_Examples/4-0 DOM Interface');">code</button>
					</div>
				<p>In this example, we'll use the titular character from <a href="https://www.frogatto.com/">Frogatto & Friends</a>, and display a small interactive message.</p>
				<p><span class="cjs-line 72">When our character is clicked on</span>, <span class="cjs-line 77">we register an event handler for the mouse move event</span> so we can drag Frogatto around. When that triggers, we <span class="cjs-line 81">draw him</span> and then <span class="cjs-line 80">recalculate the position of the speech bubble</span>. (If we don't do both these at once, it will look strange as the speech bubble will move across the screen at a higher framerate than Frogatto will.) To extract the positioning information for the HTML speech bubble, we'll use <span class="cjs-line 95">the player's localToGlobal function</span> and specify an offset for the speech bubble to be at.</p>
				<h3>Example 5: Reading from Canvas</h3>
				<p>While CreateJS is nice, sometimes you want to "drop down to the wire"… so to speak… and work with the raw canvas itself. CreateJS imposes some restrictions on how we can do this – we can't just interject arbitrary commands into our drawing chain. We can, however, read from or write to a cached canvas. In the following example, we'll write a minimalistic game to use as the seed data, and then write a droplet pixel effect in Javascript.</p>
				<iframe id="pixel-1" class="iframe-player" data-code-source="blog-posts/03.CreateJS_Examples/5-0 Pixel Effects" width="346" height="274" scrolling="no"></iframe>
					<div class="iframe-player-buttons">
						<button onclick="createjsExamples.play('pixel-1', 'blog-posts/03.CreateJS_Examples/5-0 Pixel Effects');">play</button>
						<button onclick="createjsExamples.stop('pixel-1');">stop</button>
						<button onclick="createjsExamples.show('pixel-1', 'blog-posts/03.CreateJS_Examples/5-0 Pixel Effects');">code</button>
					</div>
				<p>To put together our scene, <span class="cjs-line 10 21">we'll define a forest background via CSS</span> because it is very simple to do it that way. We also <span class="cjs-line 12">position the game canvas on top of everything else</span>, because we want to be able to put some lighting effects over our droplet output.</p>
				<p>After we set up our stage, the next segment of our program defines the CreateJS spritesheet that we'll use as our player. We then <span class="cjs-line 68">create a new player object itself from the spritesheet</span>.</p>
				<p>On line 74, we have <span class="cjs-line 74">a function that describes, in the form f(<em>x</em>), the lowest point <em>y</em> we can be at</span>. When we move Frogatto, we <span class="cjs-line 85">use this to make sure he's never lower than the ground</span>. The <span class="cjs-line 95">key down</span> and <span class="cjs-line 115">key up</span> event listeners set velocity and orientation of the player.</p>
				<p>Now that we have our minimalistic platformer up and running, we'll add a pixel effect to the black bit underneath our feet. This is covered by <span class="cjs-line 22">the second canvas</span>, and won't use CreateJS.</p>
				<iframe id="pixel-2" class="iframe-player" data-code-source="blog-posts/03.CreateJS_Examples/5-1 Pixel Effects" width="346" height="274" scrolling="no"></iframe>
					<div class="iframe-player-buttons">
						<button onclick="createjsExamples.play('pixel-2', 'blog-posts/03.CreateJS_Examples/5-1 Pixel Effects');">play</button>
						<button onclick="createjsExamples.stop('pixel-2');">stop</button>
						<button onclick="createjsExamples.show('pixel-2', 'blog-posts/03.CreateJS_Examples/5-1 Pixel Effects');">code</button>
					</div>
				<p>Here, we've added <span class="cjs-line 123">a section of Javascript to the end of our file</span>. Every five frames <span class="cjs-line 131">it copies the last line of our CreateJS-controlled canvas to the first line of the background canvas</span>. We can read from any cached object in CreateJS this way. The stage itself is always cached to canvas, since that is what is displayed on screen.</p>
				<p>This appears to work as it should. The next bit… not so much. While it still runs and demonstrates the point of the tutorial, it does not do so <em>correctly</em>, and I can't figure out why. When I run the program, I see some blooms of colour coming in from the bottom of the image – but there should be nothing of interest seeded there. (It's also rather slow, so no <a href="https://www.wab.com/" class="external">street cred</a> for me in that department either.)</p>
				<p>Due to the highly repetitive, cpu-bound nature of the shader effect, I've pulled out many variables for caching and ease of manipulation. Of particular note is <span class="cjs-line 139">the dataSize variable</span>, which ensures we don't have to <span class="cjs-line 151">look up an expensively-derived length property in an important loop</span>.</p>
				<p>There are a few options when it comes to looping over an array in Javascript. In order of speed, from slowest to fastest: array.map → array.forEach → reversed for-loop → for-loop. However, I advise using map and forEach when possible, because there are less moving parts to mess up compared to a for-loop.</p>
				<p>The way <span class="cjs-line 154">our pixel effect</span> works is fairly simple, in theory. In the typed array that contains our image data, we have each channel of each pixel of each line of our image, all one after the other. Our code here looks forward/back one row, then one pixel, and then both. It takes the maximum value it finds. It then subtracts 2 from that value, to make our effect disappear after a while. The result is written to a new array so it doesn't interfere with calculating the next pixel. This doesn't wrap around to 255 after 0, because we are writing to a <a class="cjs-line 142 external" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Typed_arrays#Typed_array_subclasses">Uint8ClampedArray</a>. Since Javascript lets us read from outside the defined array, our code will simply fail for the first and last lines, returning NaN to the Uint8ClampedArray. This is converted to 0, so the first and last rows of our image will be black.</p>
				<h3>Afterword</h3>
				<p>I hope this provides some examples of good architecture in CreateJS. In some cases, I've chosen simplicity over correctness. I feel this is an acceptable trade-off, because it is much easier to correct something in-place than it is to rearchitect it. Good luck with your project!</p>

					Computer games are, in broad terms, systems of exchange. The player can exchange gold coins for a fancy sword; time and attention for progress; or the player can sit back and watch the game exchange stuff with itself. By graphing interactions between the player and bits of the game, we can see what the focus of the play of the game will be. Lets start off by looking at the simplest example there is, <a class="external" href="http://progressquest.com/">Progress Quest</a><a class="lp" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W2DyOWPbAA"></a>.
				</p>
				<figure>
					<img alt='One relationship, here: time positively influences progress through the game.' src='blog-posts/02.Flowcharts_of_Game_Mechanics/Progress Quest.svg'>
					<figcaption><strong>Progress Quest:</strong> Time is exchanged for progress, no effort on behalf of the player required. If a repetitive task can be optimized, it should be, right?</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<p>
					The player is not noted on this graph, as the player is only involved during the setup of the game. Like <a class="external" href="https://rob-bell.net/2009/06/a-beginners-guide-to-big-o-notation/">big O notation</a>, our graphs will disregard one-time costs.

				<!-- A more complicated example might be <a class="external" href="https://company.zynga.com/games/farmville">Farmville</a><a class='lp' href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poq5RSNmYnM"></a>, which I have not actually played. In <em>general</em>, I gather you trade attention for currency by growing crops. Generally, the more attention you pay the game, the more currency it gives you. You can trade others' attention for currency, too, by bugging friends for it. You can trade more of your attention by getting a job, using it to convert your attention to money, and converting the real money into in-game currency. You can then trade currency in for better ways to get currency. The focus of play seems to be on getting currency. -->
				<h3>OpenTTD</h3>
				<p>
					A rather more interesting example is <a class="external" href="https://www.openttd.org">Open Transport Tycoon Deluxe</a><a class='lp' href="https://youtu.be/ic-lzaJigDk?t=10m"></a>. As with many games, you are limited in your actions by your budget. You can actually earn enough money that it becomes a non-issue, however, at which point you are limited simply by the amount of time you can actually put in to building new routes. (Side note: This presents a curious inversion to Zynga games such as <a class="external" href="https://company.zynga.com/games/farmville">Farmville</a><a class='lp' href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poq5RSNmYnM"></a>, which progress slower as you progress. OpenTTD <strong>accelerates</strong> the pace as the game goes on.) The chart below describes one facet of the game, the routes you have your vehicles haul goods over to make money.
				</p>
				<figure>
					<img alt='A complex graph of relationships in OpenTTD.' src='blog-posts/02.Flowcharts_of_Game_Mechanics/OpenTTD.svg'>
					<img src='blog-posts/02.Flowcharts_of_Game_Mechanics/Key.svg'>
					<figcaption><strong>OpenTTD:</strong> An unsubtle graph, containing the loudest relationships.</figcaption>
				</figure>
				<p>
					A route can (basically) be graded on a handful of characteristics; straightness, decongestion, infrastructure, and potential. To examine straightness: First, it takes more effort to make a straight route. Other things have to moved out of the way. So more effort positively affects straightness. It costs money to (re)move things, so straightness negatively affects money. However, it positively affects decongestion, which (following the arrows) leads to vehicles having higher speed, which leads to progressing along the route faster, which leads to more money. So, straightness is an investment which will return long-term. Since the interaction graph is very circular like this, we can conclude that OpenTTD is a game of investments, with a strong focus on money.
				</p>
				<p>
					Or, say we have a length of railway that is not congested yet. Our effort could be better spent somewhere else, even though the decongestion of the route would decrease. The route would have less future potential to generate revenue, since trains would progress slower along the route as they got in their way. We could spend that effort making the route longer, or making it straighter.
				</p>
				<p>
					Alternatively, we might have to wait for some time to pass, and for existing investments to pay off.
				</p>
				<h3>Sim City</h3>
				<p>
					In <a class="external" href="https://www.ea.com/simcity-4-deluxe">Sim City 4</a><a class='lp' href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMzz2LPYYsY"></a>, we would have a <em>lot</em> of arrows pointing to and from the transit system of our city. Take the power system: the power system basically goes currency → power plant → city growth → currency. The water system works exactly the same way, with no other significant effects. Transit systems, however, are in demand based on terrain, where stuff has been zoned, and what neighbours you have. Their ability to supply the demand is lowered when demand is high. They directly generate currency, in addition to consuming it. They're comprised of roads, rails, airports, subways, and so on. The partial failure of transit systems can lower or raise demand on all systems, sometimes spectacularly so – in addition to positively or negatively affecting city growth! In terms of city infrastructure, you will put down more transit tiles than other infrastructure combined.
				</p>
				<p>
					Since there are no other systems which interact deeply as transit does, we can conclude the Sim City 4 revolves around transit. This is a bit of thematic clash with the presentation of the game, which is to build a <em>city</em>. By charting relationships before building a game, we can foresee such problems and know what steps to take to avoid them.
				</p>
				<p>
					Every version of Sim City, and most other earlier Maxis games, adhere to a effort-time-currency pyramid. You can put effort in, if you don't have to wait for a period of time to get enough currency to fund your efforts. This is a very popular model for simulation-genre games, and is seen in such games as <a class="external" href="https://www.openttd.org">Open TTD</a><a class='lp' href="https://youtu.be/ic-lzaJigDk?t=10m"></a>, the <a class="external" href="https://www.tropico3.com/us/index.php">Tropico</a><a class='lp' href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jhb1wzRtgs"></a> series, and <a class="external" href=https://www.old-games.com/download/4506/yoot-tower>YooT Tower</a><a class='lp' href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afgaeCdw-4s"></a>. (YooT Tower is a sequel to the more popular Sim Tower.)
				</p>
				<h3>A Dark Room</h3>
				<p>
					I found an interesting game a few days ago. It is very well designed, and can be played at <a class="external" href="https://adarkroom.doublespeakgames.com/">Doublespeak Games</a>' site. The game takes a fairly extreme approach the graph of interactions. It starts with one. You move up from there. (This is the polar opposite of <a class="external" href="https://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/">Dwarf Fortress</a><a class='lp' href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQUihAU6GHE"></a>.) A Dark Room is ridiculously easy to learn, and it stays fresh throughout the game as the number of interactions expands.
