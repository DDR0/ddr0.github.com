		<p>This is a log of #<a href="http://www.frogatto.com/">Frogatto</a> the evening of Feb. 7 and the morning of Feb. 8, 2013.</p>

			<div class="name">&lt;vultraz&gt;</div> <p class="dialog">Have you guys heard of an artist named Andree Wallin?</p>
			<div class="name">&lt;Jetrel&gt;</div> <p class="dialog">Nope.</p>

			<div class="name">&lt;vultraz&gt;</div> <p class="dialog">He could give LordBob a run for his money</p>
			<div class="name">&lt;Jetrel&gt;</div> <p class="dialog">He could give Craig Mullins a run for his money. :|</p>
			<p>|&lt;-- emptty has left freenode (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)</p>
			<div class="name">&lt;Jetrel&gt;</div> <p class="dialog">Yeah, I'm pretty sure this guy's out of our league.</p>
			<div class="name">&lt;vultraz&gt;</div> <p class="dialog">Who's Craig Mullins?</p>
			<div class="name">&lt;Jetrel&gt;</div> <p class="dialog">vultraz:  one of the older "matte painters" out there, who kinda established that style</p>
			<div class="name">&lt;Jetrel&gt;</div> <p class="dialog"><a href="http://www.goodbrush.com/">www.goodbrush.com</a></p>
			<div class="name">&lt;vultraz&gt;</div> <p class="dialog">Wallin could give this guy a run for his money </p>
			<div class="name">&lt;Jetrel&gt;</div> <p class="dialog">Yeah.</p>
			<div class="name">&lt;vultraz&gt;</div> <p class="dialog">I didn't even know it was possible to achieve such level of photo-realism</p>
			<div class="name">&lt;vultraz&gt;</div> <p class="dialog">I wish I knew how he does it</p>
			<p>--&gt;| emptty (~mquinson@ANancy-552-1-15-169.w92-138.abo.wanadoo.fr) has joined #frogatto</p>
			<div class="name">&lt;Jetrel&gt;</div> <p class="dialog">... it's complicated.</p>
			<div class="name">&lt;vultraz&gt;</div> <p class="dialog">How so?</p>
			<div class="name">&lt;Jetrel&gt;</div> <p class="dialog">:P</p>
			<div class="name">&lt;Jetrel&gt;</div> <p class="dialog">Rather like rocket science.</p>
			<div class="name">&lt;Jetrel&gt;</div> <p class="dialog">Honestly a lot of it has to do with brain-hacking.</p>
			<div class="name">&lt;Jetrel&gt;</div> <p class="dialog">You simply can't get that good via practice.</p>
			<div class="name">&lt;Jetrel&gt;</div> <p class="dialog">"practice alone", I mean.</p>
			<div class="name">&lt;Jetrel&gt;</div> <p class="dialog">One of the caveats most people don't "get" is that many of the most difficult endeavors you can approach in life, like art, or programming, or music, etc, are not things where you get a nice, linear payoff for practice.</p>
			<div class="name">&lt;vultraz&gt;</div> <p class="dialog">Basically you have to know ALL the things?</p>
			<div class="name">&lt;Jetrel&gt;</div> <p class="dialog">As proof, there are whole droves of webcomic artists out there who do massive, massive workloads - they pump out a whole page (e.g. 5-10 drawings) every other day, and they suck.</p>
			<div class="name">&lt;Jetrel&gt;</div> <p class="dialog">Even after 10+ years.</p>
			<div class="name">&lt;Jetrel&gt;</div> <p class="dialog">It's not a choice of deciding to suck, either.</p>
			<div class="name">&lt;vultraz&gt;</div> <p class="dialog">well, knowledge without creativity is useless</p>
			<div class="name">&lt;Jetrel&gt;</div> <p class="dialog">vultraz:  this has absolutely nothing to do with "creativity".</p>
			<div class="name">&lt;Jetrel&gt;</div> <p class="dialog">They're not deciding that "this is good enough, I don't need to get any better".  Hands-down, any one of them would love to be as good as that painter you linked - they'd probably give their off-hand to get that good.</p>
			<div class="name">&lt;Jetrel&gt;</div> <p class="dialog">The thing is that practice, in order to yield a boost in skill, needs to be carefully "shaped".</p>
			<div class="name">&lt;Jetrel&gt;</div> <p class="dialog">Just doing a pageful of drawings won't make you better (after a certain point).</p>
			<div class="name">&lt;Jetrel&gt;</div> <p class="dialog">So you have to strategically design each exercise you do to 1] deal with things you don't understand 2] run some sort of hypothesis on a pass-fail basis  3] have some sort of correctness criterion you can actually compare against.</p>
			<div class="name">&lt;vultraz&gt;</div> <p class="dialog">So..you need....uh...try to be better?</p>
			<div class="name">&lt;Jetrel&gt;</div> <p class="dialog">"Just trying" isn't enough.</p>
			<div class="name">&lt;vultraz&gt;</div> <p class="dialog">You need to 'be' better?</p>
			<div class="name">&lt;Jetrel&gt;</div> <p class="dialog">Yeah.</p>
			<div class="name">&lt;Jetrel&gt;</div> <p class="dialog">You need some way to measure if you really are getting better or not.</p>
			<div class="name">&lt;Jetrel&gt;</div> <p class="dialog">So for example a guy like that needs to be doing lots of practice "drawing things photorealistically", and that means that when he does practice like that, he actually needs real things to compare against.</p>
			<div class="name">&lt;Jetrel&gt;</div> <p class="dialog">And most emphatically, this doesn't mean "grabbing a real photo, looking at it, and drawing what he sees".</p>
			<div class="name">&lt;Jetrel&gt;</div> <p class="dialog">Because if you're doing that, you're not "solving the lighting problem" yourself - that's already been pre-calculated for you by reality.</p>
			<div class="name">&lt;Jetrel&gt;</div> <p class="dialog">What a guy like him is basically doing is building a human raytracer.</p>
			<div class="name">&lt;Jetrel&gt;</div> <p class="dialog">So to test if it's accurate, he needs to set up an imaginary scene, render it by painting it, and THEN check it against a real scene.</p>
			<div class="name">&lt;vultraz&gt;</div> <p class="dialog">And keep doing so until he can do it right?</p>
			<div class="name">&lt;Jetrel&gt;</div> <p class="dialog">I.e. then set up a real scene to compare it with - or something vaguely close enough to test the basic gist of it.</p>
			<div class="name">&lt;Jetrel&gt;</div> <p class="dialog">Yeah - THEN practice kicks in as a necessary.</p>
			<div class="name">&lt;Jetrel&gt;</div> <p class="dialog">But just practice alone won't do it.</p>
			<div class="name">&lt;Jetrel&gt;</div> <p class="dialog">You can spend a lifetime practicing the wrong way and remain "mediocre at best".</p>
			<div class="name">&lt;vultraz&gt;</div> <p class="dialog">So basically...you need to keep improving yourself, and that improvement happens with practice...?</p>
			<div class="name">&lt;Jetrel&gt;</div> <p class="dialog">Even though you're trying as hard as humanly possible to get better, and crying yourself to sleep every night because the struggle is so epic.</p>
			<div class="name">&lt;Jetrel&gt;</div> <p class="dialog">vultraz:  no, it cannot be simplified to a statement that terse.</p>
			<div class="name">&lt;vultraz&gt;</div> <p class="dialog">Sorry, I just don't exactly completely understand what you're trying to say</p>
			<div class="name">&lt;Jetrel&gt;</div> <p class="dialog">vultraz:  if you simplify it that much, you're deleting crucial information.</p>
			<div class="name">&lt;Jetrel&gt;</div> <p class="dialog">I'm not sure how to make myself more clear.</p>
			<div class="name">&lt;Jetrel&gt;</div> <p class="dialog">Uhm...</p>
			<div class="name">&lt;Jetrel&gt;</div> <p class="dialog">It's like if you're doing music, you can spend a lifetime reading from sheet music, and not learn to improvise.</p>
			<div class="name">&lt;Jetrel&gt;</div> <p class="dialog">But it's more nuanced and more complicated than that.</p>
			<div class="name">&lt;Jetrel&gt;</div> <p class="dialog">Actually music is a good example, because it has a built in "correctness" metric.</p>
			<div class="name">&lt;Jetrel&gt;</div> <p class="dialog">You can't just bang random notes on a piano.</p>
			<div class="name">&lt;Jetrel&gt;</div> <p class="dialog">And that's basically the problem with the way most people "practice" art.</p>
			<div class="name">&lt;Jetrel&gt;</div> <p class="dialog">They do drawings, they want to improve, they practice, but they don't get any better.</p>
			<div class="name">&lt;Jetrel&gt;</div> <p class="dialog">And they don't get better because they're not testing their work against a "correctness" metric.</p>
			<div class="name">&lt;Jetrel&gt;</div> <p class="dialog">They're just doing more drawings..  maybe they're better, maybe they're worse, they can't really tell.</p>
			<div class="name">&lt;Jetrel&gt;</div> <p class="dialog">The problem is it's insanely hard TO tell!</p>
			<div class="name">&lt;Jetrel&gt;</div> <p class="dialog">It's so subtle!</p>
			<div class="name">&lt;vultraz&gt;</div> <p class="dialog">So you need a benchmark?</p>
			<div class="name">&lt;Jetrel&gt;</div> <p class="dialog">EXACTLY!</p>
			<div class="name">&lt;Jetrel&gt;</div> <p class="dialog">Exactly, exactly exactly!</p>
			<div class="name">&lt;Jetrel&gt;</div> <p class="dialog">You need a benchmark.</p>
			<div class="name">&lt;Jetrel&gt;</div> <p class="dialog">You need to 1] make a hypothesis that if you change some part of your method, it will work better.  2] be able to benchmark, rigorously, that yes, that is in fact better.</p>
			<div class="name">&lt;Jetrel&gt;</div> <p class="dialog">That's the secret to being an extraordinary artist like that.</p>
			<div class="name">&lt;Jetrel&gt;</div> <p class="dialog">It is, in fact - the scientific method.</p>
			<div class="name">&lt;Jetrel&gt;</div> <p class="dialog">Not just practicing, but applying "engineering methodology" to your practice - carefully benchmarking it, locking variables, performing triage, et cetera to carefully confirm you're actually getting better.</p>
			<div class="name">&lt;Jetrel&gt;</div> <p class="dialog">So many poor souls don't ever learn that. :(</p>
			<div class="name">&lt;Jetrel&gt;</div> <p class="dialog">Sadly... because normal people don't get scientist training in our society. :(</p>
			<div class="name">&lt;Jetrel&gt;</div> <p class="dialog">They get some general education courses on science, regurgitating some facts, but they don't actually get taught "how to use the scientific method".</p>
			<div class="name">&lt;vultraz&gt;</div> <p class="dialog">So it's not just knowing how to draw - it's knowing how to draw, knowing how to improve, and then actually improving</p>
			<div class="name">&lt;Jetrel&gt;</div> <p class="dialog">vultraz:  that's a better way to put it. :)</p>
			<div class="name">&lt;Jetrel&gt;</div> <p class="dialog">And the way to improve, is by using the scientific method.</p>
			<div class="name">&lt;Jetrel&gt;</div> <p class="dialog">So guys like that spend years training their intuition using this method, and are gradually able to become human raytracers.</p>
			<div class="name">&lt;Jetrel&gt;</div> <p class="dialog">And then when they sit down to draw something like that, it's able to just "flow".</p>
			<p>|&lt;-- emptty has left freenode (Ping timeout: 276 seconds)</p>
			<div class="name">&lt;vultraz&gt;</div> <p class="dialog">Isn't the scientific method that boring chapter at the beginning of your grade school science textbooks that no one really pays attention to?</p>
			<div class="name">&lt;Jetrel&gt;</div> <p class="dialog">Yep.</p>
			<p>--&gt;| kodaws (~koda@host81-31-static.85-94-b.business.telecomitalia.it) has joined #frogatto</p>
			<div class="name">&lt;vultraz&gt;</div> <p class="dialog">I'll admit, I always considered that chapter usless</p>
			<div class="name">&lt;vultraz&gt;</div> <p class="dialog">Don't even remember the general steps</p>
			<div class="name">&lt;Jetrel&gt;</div> <p class="dialog">It's useless for getting homework done.</p>
			<p>--&gt;| zookeeper (~lmsnie@wesnoth/developer/zookeeper) has joined #frogatto</p>
			<div class="name">&lt;Jetrel&gt;</div> <p class="dialog">It's probably the most useful idea to bring away from it for the real world.</p>
			<div class="name">&lt;Jetrel&gt;</div> <p class="dialog">Because out in RL, work generally isn't done by spec.</p>
			<div class="name">&lt;Jetrel&gt;</div> <p class="dialog">In RL, you generally get thrown into situations where you have no freaking clue what you're supposed to how, how you're supposed to do it, and where to even start.</p>
			<div class="name">&lt;vultraz&gt;</div> <p class="dialog">Half the stuff you learn in school is useless in RL</p>
			<div class="name">&lt;Jetrel&gt;</div> <p class="dialog">Yep.</p>
			<div class="name">&lt;vultraz&gt;</div> <p class="dialog">In school, where's the class for dealing with unexpected situations</p>
			<div class="name">&lt;Jetrel&gt;</div> <p class="dialog">EXACTLY.</p>
			<div class="name">&lt;vultraz&gt;</div> <p class="dialog">No, you sit around learning capitals on obscure African countries.</p>
			<div class="name">&lt;Jetrel&gt;</div> <p class="dialog">One reason for this is that school curriculum design subconsciously tries to avoid teaching things which can't be tested well.</p>
			<div class="name">&lt;Jetrel&gt;</div> <p class="dialog">They gravitate towards stuff that has clear, easy-to-test answers.</p>
			<div class="name">&lt;Jetrel&gt;</div> <p class="dialog">Facts.</p>
			<div class="name">&lt;vultraz&gt;</div> <p class="dialog">It's probably why students tend to memorize stuff for tests, then forget it</p>
			<div class="name">&lt;Jetrel&gt;</div> <p class="dialog">Facts aren't useless, and neither is rote memorization, but they're only useful as an ingredient IN critical thinking.</p>
			<div class="name">&lt;vultraz&gt;</div> <p class="dialog">The tests determine everything, as long as you can pass those, you're golden. At least, that's how it seems</p>
			<div class="name">&lt;Jetrel&gt;</div> <p class="dialog">Like if you have to, say, program a videogame like frogatto, the rote memorization of how trig functions work is really helpful at writing monster logic.</p>
			<div class="name">&lt;vultraz&gt;</div> <p class="dialog">True. But too often it's just used so you can answer a question on a test.</p>
			<div class="name">&lt;Jetrel&gt;</div> <p class="dialog">And a substantial bedrock of that stuff helps - like if you don't even know basic arithmetic, you just get crushed trying to do basic things.</p>
			<div class="name">&lt;Jetrel&gt;</div> <p class="dialog">But yeah - schools take that way too far.</p>
			<div class="name">&lt;Jetrel&gt;</div> <p class="dialog">Because it's the easy cop-out no one can reasonably fault them for doing.</p>
			<div class="name">&lt;vultraz&gt;</div> <p class="dialog">Tests are meant to find out how much you know, but instead, they've become this thing where you have to pass or you lose.</p>
