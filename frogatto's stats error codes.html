		<h1>Error Codes</h1>
		<p id="proper">Since the renderer is a web app, it relies on non-local servers to give it information. Due to this, it can be rather flakey at times. Here is a list of common errors:</p>
		<hr>
		<p>Symptoms: Black background, white 'processing' text.</p>
		<p>Cause: Level not loading. This is most probably because it doesn't exist on the stats server, but may also be because you've lost your internet connection.</p>
