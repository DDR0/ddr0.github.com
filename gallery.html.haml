					/Measured width/height is 641, 643. Half that is 320, 321. We have two margins, so half that is 160/161. Margin right is +2ex.

					%h2 Candy Crunch
					%p Over the course of two weeks in the spring of 2013, I was commissioned by a company called <a href="http://ayogo.com">Ayogo</a> to program a match-3 game. Candy Crunch was the outcome. Match more than three candies together to score a bonus. There is also a <a href="Candy Crunch/index.html">double-sized version</a>. You can <button onclick="$('#candy-crush')[0].contentWindow.location.reload()">restart</button> the game.

					%h2 Editabled Pre-Alpha
					%p An editable pixel editor. Eventually. You can draw sharp lines on it with your mouse and non-destructively move around with the arrow keys. (Hold alt and click on the example to grant it keyboard focus.) Infinite scroll in any direction. Features a custom multi-threaded compositing engine. You can <button onclick="var e = $('#editabled')[0]; e.src = e.src; //Basically, we're not allowed to reload the window content here because it's not of this domain. Perhaps we should, uh, make it so. Considering this is what it was meant for.">clear</button> the canvas if you've messed up, since there is no ereaser yet. There is a <a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/138485812/editabled/fullscreen.html">full-screen version</a>.
