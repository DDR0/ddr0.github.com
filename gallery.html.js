					<h2>Chronos UI & Web API</h2>
					<p>Between 2018 and 2020 I worked on the Chronos High-Speed Camera, from <a href="https://krontech.ca">Kron Technologies</a>. Among other jobs, I redesigned the camera's UI and added a remote-control web API to it. The update was generally well-received, and can be applied to your camera by following the instructions on <a href="http://forum.krontech.ca/index.php?topic=531.msg2999#msg2999">the forum release thread</a>.</p>
					<p>A picture of <a href="images/gallery/chronos-1.png">the new UI</a> is also available. (Compare with this screen from <a href="images/gallery/chronos-3.png">the original one</a>.)</p>
					<p>I also worked on the Chronos Ring, a loop of 100 cameras, as seen on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qPvpl91jIvc">Beyond the Press</a>.

					<h2>Candy Crunch</h2>
					<p>Over the course of two weeks in the spring of 2013, I was commissioned by a company called <a href="https://ayogo.com">Ayogo</a> to program a match-3 game. Candy Crunch was the outcome. Match more than three candies together to score a bonus. There is also a <a href="Candy Crunch/index.html">double-sized version</a>. You can <button onclick="$('#candy-crush')[0].contentWindow.location.reload()">restart</button> the game.</p>

					<h2>Cube Trains</h2>
					<p>A 3D puzzle game with a train theme, which I made over the course of 2011. It features roughly a dozen puzzles of varying difficulty, and has an expansion pack which grants 11 more. While I considered it rather nice, it was a commercial failure. Comes with editor & player. Code on <a href="https://github.com/DDR0/Cube_Trains">Github</a>. No digital rights management software included.</p>

					<h2>Cityecho</h2>
					<p>An old startup I cofounded, to try to improve the rental market in Vancouver. The idea was that, if folk could get together and find roommates more easily, then they could split larger houses than they do now and everyone would have to pay less in aggregate. This did not pan out, as we failed to bootstrap the project and a late pivot into rental payment did not work either.</p>

					<h2>ComeFrom 2</h2>
					<p>ComeFrom 2 is an esoteric language which explores the implications of only being able to COMEFROM lines, not GOTO them. Since no stupid idea is any use if it's not accessible, an <a href="https://ddr0.github.io/side projects/cfl/">online IDE</a> is available. Be sure to run the 'Counting Up to Ten' program! For a more detailed explanation and introduction, see the <a href="https://esolangs.org/wiki/ComeFrom2">esolangs.org page</a>.</p>
					<p>ComeFrom's real coup de gr√¢ce, however, is the <em>conditional</em> comefrom. By examining the top variable on the stack, we eliminate the need for if-based conditionals and loops entirely.</p>

					<p>A pixel editor demo. You can draw sharp lines on it with your mouse and move around with the arrow keys. (Hold alt and click on the example to grant it keyboard focus.) Infinite scroll in any direction. Features a multi-threaded compositing engine. You can <button onclick="var e = $('#editabled')[0]; e.src = e.src; //Basically, we're not allowed to reload the window content here because it's not of this domain. Perhaps we should, uh, make it so.">clear</button> the canvas if you've messed up, since there is no ereaser yet. There is a <a href="editabled/fullscreen.html">full-page version</a>.</p>
