        <h2>Batch Convert Gif Animations to Spritesheets</h2>
        
        <p>During some recent work on the <a href="http://www.pixeljoint.com/2015/01/21/4521/Open_Pixel_Platformer_is_back.htm">Open Pixel Platformer</a>, I had many finished .gif animations which I needed to make into spritesheets. To convert them all, I wrote a script to automate the task.</p>
        
        <div class="code-container">
        <code>gifs=`find . -iname '*.gif'`</code><br>
        <code>echo "Queuing $(echo "$gifs" | wc -l) gif animations to be converted to png spritesheets. Queued images may take a while to process in the background."</code><br>
        <code>echo "$gifs" | while read gif; do</code><br>
        <code>    png=${gif/.gif/.png} #convert *.gif filename to *.png filename.</code><br>
        <code>    #echo queued "$gif"</code><br>
        <code>    </code><br>
        <code>    # Explanation of montage command:</code><br>

        <code>    # -background "rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.0)" \ #Set the background to stay transparent, as opposed to white. (-alpha On seems to have no effect)</code><br>
        <code>    # -quality 100 \ #The default quality is 92, but since we're dealing with pixel art we want the fidelity.</code><br>

        <span data-code-viewer-scan='start'></span>
        <p>I have found it difficult to find nice, simple examples of how to lay out an <a href="http://createjs.com/#!/EaselJS" class="external">EaselJS</a> program. The <a href="http://createjs.com/Docs/EaselJS/modules/EaselJS.html">documentation</a> and <a href="https://github.com/CreateJS/">examples</a> generally do a good job of covering the nuts and bolts of the library, but I find that some additional assembly instructions would be helpful. So, in rough order of my progression through the library, here are 5 examples:</p>
        <h3>Example 1: A Basic Scene</h3>
        <iframe id="clouds-1" class="iframe-player" data-code-source="Blog Posts/03.CreateJS Examples/1-0 Clouds.html" width="300" height="150" scrolling="no"></iframe>
        	<div class="iframe-player-buttons">
        		<button onclick="createjsExamples.play('clouds-1', 'Blog Posts/03.CreateJS Examples/1-0 Clouds.html');">play</button>
        		<button onclick="createjsExamples.stop('clouds-1');">stop</button>
        		<button onclick="createjsExamples.show('clouds-1', 'Blog Posts/03.CreateJS Examples/1-0 Clouds.html');">code</button>
        	</div>
        <script>createjsExamples.play('clouds-1', 'Blog Posts/03.CreateJS Examples/1-0 Clouds.html'); //A sort of 'hook' for the post, perhaps? Ideally, would only be enabled if this were the first post on the page.</script>
        <p>We'll start with a small platformer mockup, very basic. In it, we want to have some clouds float behind the player. We'll create a new HTML file, <span class="cjs-line 5">import our library</span>, and write a simple scene. (You can grab the library I used from <a class="external" href="http://code.createjs.com/createjs-2013.05.14.min.js">http://code.createjs.com/createjs-2013.05.14.min.js</a>. Other versions are available on the <a href="http://code.createjs.com/">CDN page</a>.)</p>
        <p>As a first attempt, we add the <span class="cjs-line 25">ground</span>, <span class="cjs-line 30">a cloud</span>, and <span class="cjs-line 41">an actor</span>. Since we're planning to add more clouds later, we've made that code a function. And – what do you know, it works! Our little cloud wafts gently across the sky, behind our actor.</p>
        <p>(Aside: To view the code for the example, I recommend moving the tab the 'code' button opens to a new window… the popup code can be a bit flaky. When you mouse over the highlights here, they'll highlight there as well. A more reliable way to view the code might be to play the example, and then select 'view frame source' from the right-click menu. The code is also available on <a href="https://github.com/DDR0/ddr0.github.com/tree/master/Blog%20Posts/03.CreateJS%20Examples">Github</a>.)</p>
        <iframe id="clouds-2" class="iframe-player" data-code-source="Blog Posts/03.CreateJS Examples/1-1 Clouds.html" width="300" height="150" scrolling="no"></iframe>
        	<div class="iframe-player-buttons">
        		<button onclick="createjsExamples.play('clouds-2', 'Blog Posts/03.CreateJS Examples/1-1 Clouds.html');">play</button>
        		<button onclick="createjsExamples.stop('clouds-2');">stop</button>
        		<button onclick="createjsExamples.show('clouds-2', 'Blog Posts/03.CreateJS Examples/1-1 Clouds.html');">code</button>
        	</div>
        <p>Here, we've added <span class="cjs-line 30 31 32 33">a function to add clouds to our scene every two seconds</span>. While the first cloud works just fine, the other clouds float over our player because they're added after the player is. An index-based solution, like "add this after the first 5 objects", will be a rolling disaster. The best way I've found so far to deal with this problem, generally, is to have named z-orders. Even giving z-orders by an arbitrary number grows difficult to manage after a while.</p>
        <p>Z-orders are also known as layers, and fill the same role as a 3D game's depth buffer.</p>
        <iframe id="clouds-3" class="iframe-player" data-code-source="Blog Posts/03.CreateJS Examples/1-2 Clouds.html" width="300" height="150" scrolling="no"></iframe>
        	<div class="iframe-player-buttons">
        		<button onclick="createjsExamples.play('clouds-3', 'Blog Posts/03.CreateJS Examples/1-2 Clouds.html');">play</button>
        		<button onclick="createjsExamples.stop('clouds-3');">stop</button>
        		<button onclick="createjsExamples.show('clouds-3', 'Blog Posts/03.CreateJS Examples/1-2 Clouds.html');">code</button>
        	</div>
        <p>Luckily, CreateJS implements the best of the three systems. They just don't tell you about it. Instead, <a href="http://www.createjs.com/Docs/EaselJS/classes/Container.html">the documentation</a> merely suggests that containers are a good way of grouping together objects that you would like to transform in the same manner. They are also a <em>great</em> way of grouping together objects you'd like to keep beneath other objects. At the start of the program, you can define all the z-orders that will exist as containers, and give them descriptive names. Now, as the program progresses, we can add objects into the right layer.</p>
        <p>Here, we've added some <span class="cjs-line 17">containers</span> to the stage, and <span class="cjs-line 23 24 25">passed those containers into the various functions that add our objects</span>. Now, although <span class="cjs-line 36 41 52">our functions are unchanged</span> from the previous example, we have our clouds correctly added to the middle layer.</p>
        <h3>Example 2: Caching & Performance</h3>
        <p>In many games, we use a board or background that we don't want to have move every frame. For example, we might have a scorecard that we put some text objects on, or a game where you have a few animated actors on a still background. We'll look at a dummy minesweeper game with two blue bars that track the mouse.</p>
        <iframe id="mines-1" class="iframe-player" data-code-source="Blog Posts/03.CreateJS Examples/2-0 Minesweeper.html" width="320" height="320" scrolling="no"></iframe>
        	<div class="iframe-player-buttons">
        		<button onclick="createjsExamples.play('mines-1', 'Blog Posts/03.CreateJS Examples/2-0 Minesweeper.html');">play</button>
        		<button onclick="createjsExamples.stop('mines-1');">stop</button>
        		<button onclick="createjsExamples.show('mines-1', 'Blog Posts/03.CreateJS Examples/2-0 Minesweeper.html');">code</button>
        	</div>
        <p>To build an example that stresses our computer a little, we'll make a simple game of minesweeper with each tile as an image object. Our play-field is <span class="cjs-line 22">40² tiles</span>, so we'll have 1600 objects to play around with. We'll lay some <span class="cjs-line 38 39">blue bars</span> on top to provide interactivity for the demo.</p>
        <p>If we play the example and open up our task manager, or shift-esc on Chrome, we can see that the game is taking up more CPU than it should be. (It uses about 90% here, and lags like crazy.) CreateJS is geared towards creating fully dynamic scenes, so unless we explicitly tell it that it can cache an object, it will render that object to canvas each frame. As a result, our simple game has to draw 1600 objects <span class="cjs-line 53">50 times a second</span>.</p>
        <iframe id="mines-2" class="iframe-player" data-code-source="Blog Posts/03.CreateJS Examples/2-1 Minesweeper.html" width="320" height="320" scrolling="no"></iframe>
        	<div class="iframe-player-buttons">
        		<button onclick="createjsExamples.play('mines-2', 'Blog Posts/03.CreateJS Examples/2-1 Minesweeper.html');">play</button>
        		<button onclick="createjsExamples.stop('mines-2');">stop</button>
        		<button onclick="createjsExamples.show('mines-2', 'Blog Posts/03.CreateJS Examples/2-1 Minesweeper.html');">code</button>
        	</div>
        <p>To fix this, we'll <span class="cjs-line 20">cache the background layer</span> that is holding the tiles. Now, when we go to draw a frame to screen, we'll just draw three objects – the background, and the two blue bars on top of it. However, we will need to refresh our cache when it goes stale. The cash starts empty, so we'll add <span class="cjs-line 31">a refresh call when we've loaded the tile image we need to update it</span> on line 31. The only time the player will invalidate the cash is when they click on a tile, so we'll add in a similar call to <span class="cjs-line 37">refresh the cache when the tile's "clicked" image is ready to be drawn</span>. (If we had used <a href="http://www.createjs.com/#!/PreloadJS">PreloadJS</a>, we wouldn't have to wait to update the cache here.)</p>
        <p>Now, making sure we stop the first example before measuring the CPU usage of the second, we find that our game only uses a little bit of our available CPU. My edition of Chrome reports about 15% usage, and I don't experience the lag that the first version had.</p>
        <p>Many older games drew the mouse cursor on screen in the manner we draw the blue bars here. This was because the common operating systems at the time could only render a simple black-and-white image as a custom cursor. This introduced around one to three frames of delay between moving the mouse and seeing the results, depending on how many steps the rendering pipeline was. This was barely noticeable when the game ran fast, but when you dipped down into 20 or 30 fps moving the mouse became a bit of a speculative operation. Today, most everything (including Javascript, via CSS) supports full-colour custom cursors.</p>

        To be honest, it has been about half a year since I wrote this and he replied and I got around to trying to figure out what was happening. I don't really know what to make of this, code-wise…
        <img class="emote" src="images/wesnoth icons/icon_pensive.gif">
        It's a remarkably different way to do things, and probably quite a bit more robust!
        </p>
        </em>
        <h3>Example 3: Resizing</h3>
        <p>A proper web-based game ought to be able to resize gracefully with the browser, especially on mobile where a game might be flipped around as the device rotates.</p>
        <p>Here, <span class="cjs-line 45 58">we'll draw a rotating circle</span>. We'll be able to see the redraw area, and any extra logic frames that are caused by our changes. If we drag the corner, we can see a bit of lag and flickering as the <span class="cjs-line 68">resizing logic</span> clears the canvas before a repaint occurs. There is a bit of messiness surrounding the resizing, because there is no event fired when a DOM element changes size.</p>

        	<div class="iframe-player-buttons">
        		<button onclick="createjsExamples.play('resize-2', 'Blog Posts/03.CreateJS Examples/3-1 Resize.html');">play</button>
        		<button onclick="createjsExamples.stop('resize-2');">stop</button>
        		<button onclick="createjsExamples.show('resize-2', 'Blog Posts/03.CreateJS Examples/3-1 Resize.html');">code</button>
        	</div>
        <p>To get rid of the resizing flicker, we just have to re-render the stage when the element is resized. This is easily accomplished by <span class="cjs-line 64">a single call to the stage's update method</span> on line 64.</p>
        <h3>Example 4: Working with the DOM</h3>
        <p>When making an HTML5 game, it is a good idea to actually use traditional HTML5 to lay out the interface for your game. Layout is, after all, what HTML5 was born for.</p>
        <iframe id="DOM-1" class="iframe-player" data-code-source="Blog Posts/03.CreateJS Examples/4-0 DOM Interface.html" width="300" height="200" scrolling="no"></iframe>
        	<div class="iframe-player-buttons">
        		<button onclick="createjsExamples.play('DOM-1', 'Blog Posts/03.CreateJS Examples/4-0 DOM Interface.html');">play</button>
        		<button onclick="createjsExamples.stop('DOM-1');">stop</button>
        		<button onclick="createjsExamples.show('DOM-1', 'Blog Posts/03.CreateJS Examples/4-0 DOM Interface.html');">code</button>
        	</div>
        <p>In this example, we'll use the titular character from <a href="http://www.frogatto.com/">Frogatto & Friends</a>, and display a small interactive message.</p>
        <p><span class="cjs-line 72">When our character is clicked on</span>, <span class="cjs-line 77">we register an event handler for the mouse move event</span> so we can drag Frogatto around. When that triggers, we <span class="cjs-line 81">draw him</span> and then <span class="cjs-line 80">recalculate the position of the speech bubble</span>. (If we don't do both these at once, it will look strange as the speech bubble will move across the screen at a higher framerate than Frogatto will.) To extract the positioning information for the HTML speech bubble, we'll use <span class="cjs-line 95">the player's localToGlobal function</span> and specify an offset for the speech bubble to be at.</p>
        <h3>Example 5: Reading from Canvas</h3>
        <p>While CreateJS is nice, sometimes you want to "drop down to the wire"… so to speak… and work with the raw canvas itself. CreateJS imposes some restrictions on how we can do this – we can't just interject arbitrary commands into our drawing chain. We can, however, read from or write to a cached canvas. In the following example, we'll write a minimalistic game to use as the seed data, and then write a droplet pixel effect in Javascript.</p>
        <iframe id="pixel-1" class="iframe-player" data-code-source="Blog Posts/03.CreateJS Examples/5-0 Pixel Effects.html" width="346" height="274" scrolling="no"></iframe>
        	<div class="iframe-player-buttons">
        		<button onclick="createjsExamples.play('pixel-1', 'Blog Posts/03.CreateJS Examples/5-0 Pixel Effects.html');">play</button>
        		<button onclick="createjsExamples.stop('pixel-1');">stop</button>
        		<button onclick="createjsExamples.show('pixel-1', 'Blog Posts/03.CreateJS Examples/5-0 Pixel Effects.html');">code</button>
        	</div>
        <p>To put together our scene, <span class="cjs-line 10 21">we'll define a forest background via CSS</span> because it is very simple to do it that way. We also <span class="cjs-line 12">position the game canvas on top of everything else</span>, because we want to be able to put some lighting effects over our droplet output.</p>
        <p>After we set up our stage, the next segment of our program defines the CreateJS spritesheet that we'll use as our player. We then <span class="cjs-line 68">create a new player object itself from the spritesheet</span>.</p>
        <p>On line 74, we have <span class="cjs-line 74">a function that describes, in the form f(<em>x</em>), the lowest point <em>y</em> we can be at</span>. When we move Frogatto, we <span class="cjs-line 85">use this to make sure he's never lower than the ground</span>. The <span class="cjs-line 95">key down</span> and <span class="cjs-line 115">key up</span> event listeners set velocity and orientation of the player.</p>
        <p>Now that we have our minimalistic platformer up and running, we'll add a pixel effect to the black bit underneath our feet. This is covered by <span class="cjs-line 22">the second canvas</span>, and won't use CreateJS.</p>
        <iframe id="pixel-2" class="iframe-player" data-code-source="Blog Posts/03.CreateJS Examples/5-1 Pixel Effects.html" width="346" height="274" scrolling="no"></iframe>
        	<div class="iframe-player-buttons">
        		<button onclick="createjsExamples.play('pixel-2', 'Blog Posts/03.CreateJS Examples/5-1 Pixel Effects.html');">play</button>
        		<button onclick="createjsExamples.stop('pixel-2');">stop</button>
        		<button onclick="createjsExamples.show('pixel-2', 'Blog Posts/03.CreateJS Examples/5-1 Pixel Effects.html');">code</button>
        	</div>
        <p>Here, we've added <span class="cjs-line 123">a section of Javascript to the end of our file</span>. Every five frames <span class="cjs-line 131">it copies the last line of our CreateJS-controlled canvas to the first line of the background canvas</span>. We can read from any cached object in CreateJS this way. The stage itself is always cached to canvas, since that is what is displayed on screen.</p>
        <p>This appears to work as it should. The next bit… not so much. While it still runs and demonstrates the point of the tutorial, it does not do so <em>correctly</em>, and I can't figure out why. When I run the program, I see some blooms of colour coming in from the bottom of the image – but there should be nothing of interest seeded there. (It's also rather slow, so no <a href="http://www.wab.com/" class="external">street cred</a> for me in that department either.)</p>
        <p>Due to the highly repetitive, cpu-bound nature of the shader effect, I've pulled out many variables for caching and ease of manipulation. Of particular note is <span class="cjs-line 139">the dataSize variable</span>, which ensures we don't have to <span class="cjs-line 151">look up an expensively-derived length property in an important loop</span>.</p>
        <p>There are a few options when it comes to looping over an array in Javascript. In order of speed, from slowest to fastest: array.map → array.forEach → reversed for-loop → for-loop. However, I advise using map and forEach when possible, because there are less moving parts to mess up compared to a for-loop.</p>
        <p>The way <span class="cjs-line 154">our pixel effect</span> works is fairly simple, in theory. In the typed array that contains our image data, we have each channel of each pixel of each line of our image, all one after the other. Our code here looks forward/back one row, then one pixel, and then both. It takes the maximum value it finds. It then subtracts 2 from that value, to make our effect disappear after a while. The result is written to a new array so it doesn't interfere with calculating the next pixel. This doesn't wrap around to 255 after 0, because we are writing to a <a class="cjs-line 142 external" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Typed_arrays#Typed_array_subclasses">Uint8ClampedArray</a>. Since Javascript lets us read from outside the defined array, our code will simply fail for the first and last lines, returning NaN to the Uint8ClampedArray. This is converted to 0, so the first and last rows of our image will be black.</p>
        <h3>Afterword</h3>
        <p>I hope this provides some examples of good architecture in CreateJS. In some cases, I've chosen simplicity over correctness. I feel this is an acceptable trade-off, because it is much easier to correct something in-place than it is to rearchitect it. Good luck with your project!</p>

        <h2>Diagrams and Charts of Game Mechanics</h2>
        <p>
          Computer games are, in broad terms, systems of exchange. The player can exchange gold coins for a fancy sword; time and attention for progress; or the player can sit back and watch the game exchange stuff with itself. By graphing interactions between the player and bits of the game, we can see what the focus of the play of the game will be. Lets start off by looking at the simplest example there is, <a class="external" href="http://progressquest.com/">Progress Quest</a><a class="lp" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0W2DyOWPbAA"></a>.
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img alt='One relationship, here: time positively influences progress through the game.' src='Blog Posts/02.Flowcharts of Game Mechanics/Progress Quest.svg'>
          <figcaption><strong>Progress Quest:</strong> Time is exchanged for progress, no effort on behalf of the player required. If a repetitive task can be optimized, it should be, right?</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          The player is not noted on this graph, as the player is only involved during the setup of the game. Like <a class="external" href="http://rob-bell.net/2009/06/a-beginners-guide-to-big-o-notation/">big O notation</a>, our graphs will disregard one-time costs.
        </p>
        <!-- %h3 Farmville -->
        <!-- %p -->
        <!-- A more complicated example might be <a class="external" href="http://company.zynga.com/games/farmville">Farmville</a><a class='lp' href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poq5RSNmYnM"></a>, which I have not actually played. In <em>general</em>, I gather you trade attention for currency by growing crops. Generally, the more attention you pay the game, the more currency it gives you. You can trade others' attention for currency, too, by bugging friends for it. You can trade more of your attention by getting a job, using it to convert your attention to money, and converting the real money into in-game currency. You can then trade currency in for better ways to get currency. The focus of play seems to be on getting currency. -->
        <h3>OpenTTD</h3>
        <p>
          A rather more interesting example is <a class="external" href="http://www.openttd.org">Open Transport Tycoon Deluxe</a><a class='lp' href="http://youtu.be/ic-lzaJigDk?t=10m"></a>. As with many games, you are limited in your actions by your budget. You can actually earn enough money that it becomes a non-issue, however, at which point you are limited simply by the amount of time you can actually put in to building new routes. (Side note: This presents a curious inversion to Zynga games such as <a class="external" href="http://company.zynga.com/games/farmville">Farmville</a><a class='lp' href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poq5RSNmYnM"></a>, which progress slower as you progress. OpenTTD <strong>accelerates</strong> the pace as the game goes on.) The chart below describes one facet of the game, the routes you have your vehicles haul goods over to make money.
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img alt='A complex graph of relationships in OpenTTD.' src='Blog Posts/02.Flowcharts of Game Mechanics/OpenTTD.svg'>
          <img src='Blog Posts/02.Flowcharts of Game Mechanics/Key.svg'>
          <figcaption><strong>OpenTTD:</strong> An unsubtle graph, containing the loudest relationships.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          A route can (basically) be graded on a handful of characteristics; straightness, decongestion, infrastructure, and potential. To examine straightness: First, it takes more effort to make a straight route. Other things have to moved out of the way. So more effort positively affects straightness. It costs money to (re)move things, so straightness negatively affects money. However, it positively affects decongestion, which (following the arrows) leads to vehicles having higher speed, which leads to progressing along the route faster, which leads to more money. So, straightness is an investment which will return long-term. Since the interaction graph is very circular like this, we can conclude that OpenTTD is a game of investments, with a strong focus on money.
        </p>
        <p>
          Or, say we have a length of railway that is not congested yet. Our effort could be better spent somewhere else, even though the decongestion of the route would decrease. The route would have less future potential to generate revenue, since trains would progress slower along the route as they got in their way. We could spend that effort making the route longer, or making it straighter.
        </p>
        <p>
          Alternatively, we might have to wait for some time to pass, and for existing investments to pay off.
        </p>
        <h3>Sim City</h3>
        <p>
          In <a class="external" href="http://www.ea.com/simcity-4-deluxe">Sim City 4</a><a class='lp' href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMzz2LPYYsY"></a>, we would have a <em>lot</em> of arrows pointing to and from the transit system of our city. Take the power system: the power system basically goes currency → power plant → city growth → currency. The water system works exactly the same way, with no other significant effects. Transit systems, however, are in demand based on terrain, where stuff has been zoned, and what neighbours you have. Their ability to supply the demand is lowered when demand is high. They directly generate currency, in addition to consuming it. They're comprised of roads, rails, airports, subways, and so on. The partial failure of transit systems can lower or raise demand on all systems, sometimes spectacularly so – in addition to positively or negatively affecting city growth! In terms of city infrastructure, you will put down more transit tiles than other infrastructure combined.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since there are no other systems which interact deeply as transit does, we can conclude the Sim City 4 revolves around transit. This is a bit of thematic clash with the presentation of the game, which is to build a <em>city</em>. By charting relationships before building a game, we can foresee such problems and know what steps to take to avoid them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every version of Sim City, and most other earlier Maxis games, adhere to a effort-time-currency pyramid. You can put effort in, if you don't have to wait for a period of time to get enough currency to fund your efforts. This is a very popular model for simulation-genre games, and is seen in such games as <a class="external" href="http://www.openttd.org">Open TTD</a><a class='lp' href="http://youtu.be/ic-lzaJigDk?t=10m"></a>, the <a class="external" href="http://www.tropico3.com/us/index.php">Tropico</a><a class='lp' href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Jhb1wzRtgs"></a> series, and <a class="external" href=http://www.old-games.com/download/4506/yoot-tower>YooT Tower</a><a class='lp' href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afgaeCdw-4s"></a>. (YooT Tower is a sequel to the more popular Sim Tower.)

        <h3>A Dark Room</h3>
        <p>
          I found an interesting game a few days ago. It is very well designed, and can be played at <a class="external" href="http://adarkroom.doublespeakgames.com/">Doublespeak Games</a>' site. The game takes a fairly extreme approach the graph of interactions. It starts with one. You move up from there. (This is the polar opposite of <a class="external" href="http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/">Dwarf Fortress</a><a class='lp' href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQUihAU6GHE"></a>.) A Dark Room is ridiculously easy to learn, and it stays fresh throughout the game as the number of interactions expands.

          And that – that is powerful stuff. <a class="external" href="http://www.valvesoftware.com/games/portal.html">Portal</a><a class='lp' href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urlwUpCDLW4&list=SP28A9E697FB499C82&index=1"></a> (the first version, at least) played the same game, to great effect, and enjoyed great success. <em>Progress</em> is a powerful thing!
