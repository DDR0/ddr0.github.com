<H1 ALIGN="center"><A NAME="focal">Software for observing behavior in natural settings</A></H1>
Version 2.75.5, released 21 July 2012.

<P align="left">I wrote the programs described below in order to record and analyze children's interactions in natural settings (homes and
schools). Because I developed this software under a Strategic Grant from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, I have placed these programs in the public domain. 
</P>
<P align="left">To down load the install file, <A HREF="observation_programs_2.75.7_install.exe">click here.</A>  The install file, 2.9 MB in size, is a self-extracting compressed (ZIP) file. Save it to disk, then click on it in Windows Explorer. The default folder (or your alternative) will be created for you and the observation programs unzipped. A program group called Observation Programs will be created on your Start - Programs menu. To uninstall the programs, simply erase these files. A 95-page manual is included, as a pdf document. (If you need a .pdf reader, you can download one for free from <A HREF="http://www.adobe.com/">Adobe</A>.) 

The <A HREF="observation_programs_2.75.5_source_code.zip">source code</A>
is also available. Although it is a text file, you will need the True Basic Gold Edition to run the source code. (See the<A HREF="http://www.truebasic.com"> True Basic web site</A> for further information.)
</P>

<P align="left">
These programs were designed for Windows. I have tested them on Windows XP, Windows 7, and Windows 10). They also run under Linux,using WINE (I have tested them on Ubuntu 20.04), and they should run on MacIntosh platforms using <A HREF="http://www.codeweavers.com">Crossover.</A>
</P>

<P align="left">A brief description of the programs follows. If you would like more detailed information before you download,
<A HREF="Observation Programs Manual.pdf">Click here to view the Manual.</A> Small sample data and recoding files are included with the installation package, so that you can run the software immediately, to see what it will do.
</P>

<H2 ALIGN="center">The programs: an overview</H2>

<P align="left">The first program in this suite is FOCAL, a program for data collection. Although designed for continuous, focal-individual
data, it can also be used to collect instantaneous scan sampling data (Altmann, 1974). Up to 100 user-defined behavior
codes and actors - targets codes are displayed on-screen. Session notes or corrections to the data file can be made at the
end of each trial or sample. Durations are recorded automatically. Normally, codes for actors, behaviours, and targets are
entered; but when coding dyadic interactions, "Quick Entry" mode allows FOCAL to insert the most recently used codes for
actor and target as defaults, so that all you need to enter are behavior codes.</P>

<P align="left">SCAN checks FOCAL data files for errors that may have been introduced during
editing.
It also reports total time observed and total events recorded.
</P>

<P align="left">KAPPA assesses reliabilities, reporting per cent agreement for each code and the entire taxonomy, kappa and the 95%
confidence interval for kappa for the entire taxonomy, and a pseudo-kappa for individual codes. It also displays for each
code the five codes most often confused with it. To assess reliability of event durations (important for time-budget
analyses), KAPPA correlates durations across observers as an overall measure of reliability, and also identifies problematic
individual codes with standardized residuals. </P>

<P align="left">Because observers coding in real time will necessarily be slightly out of synchrony even when they agree about which codes
to use, KAPPA allows the user to specify how much time discrepancy to tolerate. KAPPA can also mark and display
matching events and sequences in copies of the data files being compared, as an aid in training or in understanding
problematic levels of agreement. </P>

<P align="left">LAG assess contingency, reporting conditional probabilities for all events following (or preceding) a specified behavior, as
well as rates and frequencies. Contingencies between a specified criterion and the behaviours that follow it are assessed by
exact binomial probabilities. Several effect sizes are reported. </P>

<P align="left">Using techniques described in Bakeman and Gottman (1986), the SEARCH module of LAG finds entire sequences of contingent behavior that
begin at a specified criterion, based on output from LAG. SEARCH will automatically generate needed LAG output, or it
will examine existing output. </P>

<P align="left">When comparing sequences of behavior across groups (for instance, of aggressive and non-aggressive children), it is
necessary to know how often a sequence that was statistically significant in one group occurs in the other. The COUNT module of LAG reports
the number of occurrences for specified sequences and assesses group differences using chi-square. It will read sequences
directly from SEARCH output, or it will look for user-specified sequences.</P>

<P align="left">LAG will also produce output for log-linear analyses, if desired. This output is in the form of a BMDP
instruction set, with data. It can be run directly by BMDP 4F, or modified for use with SPSS. A STATXACT import
file is also created, so that exact chi-square probabilities can be assessed when expected probabilities are low. Thus
contingency can be assessed both for specific events and their sequelae, and generally, across the entire taxonomy.</P>

<P align="left">The TIMES module of LAG calculates time-budget results for focal-individual or instantaneous scan samples (that is, it reports durations as
proportions of total time observed, and events as proportions of total events observed). TIMES can handle multiple
simultaneous events.</P>

<P align="left">Beginning in version 2.5, the INTERVALS ANALYSIS module of LAG provides information that is helpful in setting criteria for defining episodes (of conflict, or conversations, etc.) It displays information about the intervals between criterion behaviors (e.g., conflict codes). Intervals will be short within episodes and long between them. By examing the distribution of these intervals, one can make a more informed choice of a cutpoint defining episode boundaries. The distribution of intervals is graphed, and all occurrences are listed, sorted from shortest to longest
<P align="left">The INTERVALS ANALYSIS module also allows users to generate random models of the distribution of episodes across focal samples, to see whether certain candidate criteria produce possible distributions or improbable ones.</P>

<P align="left">KAPPA and all modules of LAG permit behavior codes to be combined to form new, more inclusive categories.
LAG also allows actor and target codes to be combined, so that data can be pooled across individuals (e.g., all same-sex peers who interacted with the focal child).
Recoding information is "remembered" in small text files to facilitate use across programs.
The original data files themselves are not altered.</P>

<P align="left">Because the data and output files created by these programs are text files, they can be read and manipulated by
commonly used word processing and statistical programs, such as Word, Word Perfect, SPSS, BMDP, and R. Thus it is a
straightforward matter to transfer rates or conditional probabilities, for example, from LAG or TIMES output files to a
BMDP, R, or SPSS set-up file for further analysis. </P>

<P align="left">I would like to acknowledge the help given by Thompson Rivers University in the
development of the current Windows version of this software.

<p align="left">James Steiger also provides other useful software on his <A HREF="http://www.statpower.net/Software.html">homepage</A> for calculating confidence intervals (for eta-square and chi-square, for example), but their use is complex -- that is, rather than calculating confidence intervals directly, they provide values that can be used to calculate intervals using formulae in Smithson (2003) or Steiger (2004). A bit daunting, but possible.
